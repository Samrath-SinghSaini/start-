# start
Hello. My name is Samrath Singh Saini and I am a programmer. Well, a programmer in learning and I am starting my coding and programming journey once again today. 
This is my new Github repository and I will be uploading all my future projects, easy to hard, beginner to expert, to this repository. The goal is to have this repo act like a low effort portfolio as I start building projects and learning to code. 
At the moment, my coding knowledge is pretty rudimentary and basic, which is not great given that I am technically a computer science graduate, I do know the things I studied but I will be building upon the knowledge I have and increasing my programming and computer science knowledge. 
The end goal here, is to start here and end up with a programming job, be it as a - software developer, web developer, back-end programming, etc. 
More to come. 
Sam.
